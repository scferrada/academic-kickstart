abstract = "IMGpedia is a large-scale linked dataset that incorporates visual information of the images from the Wikimedia Commons dataset: it brings together descriptors of the visual content of 15 million images, 450 million visual-similarity relations between those images, links to image metadata from DBpedia Commons, and links to the DBpedia resources associated with individual images. In this paper we describe the creation of the IMGpedia dataset, provide an overview of its schema and statistics of its contents, offer example queries that combine semantic and visual information of images, and discuss other envisaged use-cases for the dataset."
