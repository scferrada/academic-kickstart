abstract = "IMGpedia is a linked dataset that provides a public SPARQL endpoint where users can answer queries that combine the visual similarity of images from Wikimedia Commons and semantic information from existing knowledge-bases. Our demo will show example queries that capture the potential of the current data stored in IMGpedia. We also plan to discuss potential use-cases for the dataset and ways in which we can improve the quality of the information it captures and the expressiveness of the queries."
